This is an Arduino library for LPD6803 based led Pixels. 
You can get the modules in my online shop at http://pixelinvaders.ch/?page_id=390

This Library uses the SPI bus, so the pins you need is defined by hardware:
----
Unlike software SPI which is configurable, hardware SPI works only on very specific pins. 

On the Arduino Uno, Duemilanove, etc., clock = pin 13 and data = pin 11. 
For the Arduino Mega, clock = pin 52, data = pin 51. 
For the ATmega32u4 Breakout Board and Teensy, clock = pin B1, data = B2. 

Alternately, on most boards you can use the 6-pin programming 
header for SPI output as well, in which case clock = pin 3 and data = pin 4.

thanks phil!

This Library is basically a copy and paste work and relies on work of Adafruit-WS2801-Library and FastSPI Library
